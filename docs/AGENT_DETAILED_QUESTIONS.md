**Expected Response:** "I found 47 VIP Champion guests in our system. They represent 4.7% of our guest base but generate 23% of total revenue. Their average booking value is $1,247 compared to $312 for regular guests. These guests book an average of 4.2 times per year, prefer Suite accommodations (78%), and have an average satisfaction score of 4.6/5.

### Example 2: Personalization Agent
**Question:** "What upsells should we offer to guests checking in this weekend?"

**Expected Response:** "Based on this weekend's arrivals, I've identified 23 high-potential upsell opportunities: 8 guests with spa service interest (avg propensity score 78) should be offered massage packages, 12 guests with dining preferences should receive restaurant reservation assistance, 6 business travelers should be offered executive lounge access, and 4 celebration guests should receive room upgrade offers.
