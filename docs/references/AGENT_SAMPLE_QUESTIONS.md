## 💡 **Pro Tips for Better Results**

### **✅ Do This:**
- Be specific about time periods ("this month", "last quarter")
- Mention loyalty tiers (Diamond, Gold, Silver)
- Ask follow-up questions to drill deeper
- Combine multiple data points ("high-value guests with low satisfaction")

### **❌ Avoid This:**
- Vague questions without context
- Asking for data that doesn't exist
- Too many questions at once
- Not following up on insights

### **🎯 Example Conversation Flow:**
```
1. "Show me our VIP guests with high upsell potential"
   → Agent provides list with scores

2. "What specific upsells would work best for Jane Doe?"
   → Agent gives personalized recommendations

3. "What's the revenue impact if we implement this across all VIPs?"
   → Agent provides ROI analysis
