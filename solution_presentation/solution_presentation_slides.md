### Slide 2: Industry and Customer Context – Disruption & Stakes

**Title:** "Rising guest expectations and margin pressure are forcing hotels to compete on personalization, not just price"

**Macro Forces Impacting Hospitality:**

1. **Guest Experience Revolution**
   - Modern travelers expect Netflix-level personalization in every service interaction
   - 73% of guests say personalized experiences influence their booking decisions
   - Social media amplifies both exceptional experiences and failures

2. **Direct Booking Pressure**
   - OTA commissions eating 15-25% of revenue
   - Hotels need differentiation to drive direct bookings
   - Loyalty programs alone are no longer sufficient

3. **Operating Margin Compression**
   - Labor costs rising 8-12% annually
   - Energy and supply chain volatility
   - Need to maximize revenue per guest, not just occupancy

4. **Data Fragmentation Challenge**
   - Average hotel uses 8-12 disconnected systems
   - Guest insights buried in silos (PMS, CRM, WiFi, spa, F&B)
   - No unified view of guest preferences or lifetime value

**Customer Connection:**
"[Customer Name]'s properties are experiencing these trends through declining repeat rates, increasing OTA dependence, and missed upsell opportunities from disconnected systems."

**Visual:** Infographic showing trend lines (rising guest expectations vs. declining margins) with 2-3 key statistics

**What to say:**
- "The hospitality industry is at an inflection point. Guests have been trained by Amazon and Netflix to expect personalization everywhere."
- "At the same time, your margins are under pressure—you can't just compete on price through OTAs."
- "The winners will be those who can deliver personalized, high-value experiences that drive direct bookings and repeat stays."

### Slide 3: Persona Pain and Current-State Gap

**Title:** "Today, hotel teams cannot deliver personalized experiences because guest insights are fragmented across disconnected systems"

**Target Personas:**

#### **Persona 1: VP of Operations / Hotel General Manager (Executive Buyer)**
- **Type:** Executive Buyer
- **Top Pains:**
  - Cannot see true guest lifetime value or predict which guests are at risk of churning
  - Missed upsell opportunities costing 15-20% of potential ancillary revenue
  - No visibility into which amenities drive satisfaction vs. drain resources
  - Limited ability to justify investments in guest experience improvements
- **KPIs at Risk:**
  - RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)
  - Direct booking ratio
  - Guest satisfaction scores (TripAdvisor, Google Reviews)
  - Repeat guest rate

#### **Persona 2: Revenue Manager / Director of Guest Experience (Decision Maker)**
- **Type:** Decision Maker / Practitioner
- **Top Pains:**
  - Manually compiling guest data from PMS, spa, dining, WiFi usage into Excel
  - No predictive insights on which guests to target for spa packages, room upgrades, or F&B offers
  - Cannot personalize offers in real-time based on guest behavior during their stay
  - Churn risk identified only after guests have already left negative reviews
- **KPIs at Risk:**
  - Ancillary revenue per guest
  - Upsell conversion rates
  - Guest retention and loyalty tier progression

#### **Persona 3: Data/Analytics Manager (Practitioner)**
- **Type:** Practitioner / Technical Decision Maker
- **Top Pains:**
  - Guest data siloed across 10+ systems (Opera PMS, Salesforce, Agilysys, WiFi platforms, spa booking systems)
  - No governed single source of truth for guest profiles
  - Custom point-to-point integrations are brittle and expensive
  - Cannot operationalize ML models for propensity scoring or churn prediction
- **Decision Factors:**
  - Scalable, governed data platform
  - Native AI/ML capabilities
  - Integration with existing hospitality tech stack

**The Snowflake Gap:**
"Many hotels already use Snowflake for finance, procurement, or corporate analytics. However, guest interaction data—PMS transactions, amenity usage, WiFi behavior, dining preferences, spa bookings—remains locked in operational silos. There's no unified guest 360 view, no AI-driven personalization, and no way to activate insights at the property level."

**Current State Workflow Example:**
- Revenue manager wants to send spa offers to high-value guests
- Manually exports data from PMS, spa system, and past booking history
- Spends 2-3 days in Excel creating a target list
- By the time offers go out, half the guests have already checked out
- No feedback loop to measure what worked

**Visual:** 
- **Persona cards** with headshots, titles, top 3 pains, and KPIs
- **Mini current-state diagram:** Siloed systems (PMS, CRM, Spa, F&B, WiFi) with manual Excel bridges and frustrated persona icons

**What to say:**
- "Let me introduce you to three personas we hear from constantly in hospitality."
- "The VP of Operations sees guest data fragmentation as a strategic liability—they're losing revenue and can't justify experience investments."
- "The Revenue Manager is stuck in Excel hell, manually stitching together data to create offers that arrive too late."
- "And the Data team knows they should be using Snowflake for guest intelligence, but operational data is still siloed outside the platform."

---

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "We already have a guest analytics platform from [Vendor]. Why do we need Snowflake?"

**Response:**
- "That's great—many of our best customers started with point solutions. The challenge is that those tools typically:
  - Only cover one part of the guest journey (e.g., CRM but not amenity usage)
  - Can't do advanced ML or AI without custom development
  - Don't integrate with your operational data (finance, supply chain, workforce)
- "Snowflake becomes your unified platform for all enterprise data—guest experience, operations, finance—with native AI and collaboration. Your existing tool can still be a visualization layer, but the data engine and ML move to Snowflake."

**Follow-Up:**
- "Would you be open to a technical deep dive on how we integrate with [Vendor] so you keep the best of both worlds?"

---

### Objection 2: "Our IT team is already stretched thin. We don't have bandwidth for a big data project."

**Response:**
- "That's exactly why we recommend a phased approach starting with a pilot at 1-2 properties. We handle the heavy lifting:
  - Snowflake Professional Services or partners build the data pipelines and ML models
  - Pre-built dashboards mean minimal custom development
  - Your team focuses on validation and adoption, not building from scratch
- "In fact, most customers find that Snowflake *reduces* their IT burden by eliminating 5-10 point-to-point integrations and custom reporting scripts."

**Follow-Up:**
- "Let's scope the pilot to minimize your team's time investment—we can start with just PMS and CRM data to prove value."

---

### Objection 3: "We're concerned about data privacy and GDPR compliance with guest data."

**Response:**
- "Data privacy is built into the solution:
  - Role-based access control ensures only authorized users see guest data
  - PII masking for sensitive fields (email, phone, payment info)
  - Audit trails for every data access (who, when, what)
  - Data residency controls to keep EU guest data in EU regions
- "Many of our hospitality customers are GDPR-compliant using Snowflake—we have reference architectures and best practices to share."

**Follow-Up:**
- "Would it help to schedule a session with our Snowflake security team to walk through governance controls in detail?"

---

### Objection 4: "How long until we see ROI? We need results fast."

**Response:**
- "We've seen customers achieve ROI in as little as 6 months. Here's the typical timeline:
  - Weeks 1-6: Discovery and pilot design (no ROI yet, but minimal cost)
  - Weeks 7-16: Pilot at 1-2 properties (first revenue uplift visible here)
  - Month 6: Full rollout complete with measurable KPIs
- "The key is starting with high-value, quick-win use cases like spa upsell or churn reduction—you don't have to boil the ocean on day one."

**Follow-Up:**
- "Would it help to build a detailed ROI model based on your baseline KPIs so we can quantify the timeline and payback?"

---

### Objection 5: "We've tried ML/AI before and it didn't work. Why is this different?"

**Response:**
- "We hear that a lot. The most common reasons ML projects fail in hospitality:
  1. **Data silos:** Models trained on incomplete data (e.g., just PMS, missing amenity usage)
  2. **Operationalization:** Models built in notebooks but never deployed to production
  3. **Lack of feedback loops:** No way to measure if the model's predictions are working
- "Snowflake solves all three:
  - Unified data platform ensures models have all relevant features
  - Native ML means models deploy directly in Snowflake (no separate infrastructure)
  - Built-in monitoring and retraining to continuously improve accuracy
- "Plus, we're not asking you to build models from scratch—we provide pre-built propensity models you can customize."

**Follow-Up:**
- "Would you be open to a pilot focused just on one model—say, spa upsell propensity—so we can prove the approach works before scaling?"

## Presentation Delivery Tips

### Pacing & Flow
- **Slides 1-2 (5 minutes):** Set context and urgency
- **Slide 3 (5 minutes):** Deep dive on personas—this is where you connect emotionally
- **Slides 4-6 (10 minutes):** Solution overview and architecture—balance business and technical
- **Slide 7 (5 minutes):** Persona journey—bring the solution to life with storytelling
- **Slide 8 (3 minutes):** Proof point—build credibility
- **Slides 9-10 (5 minutes):** Adoption path and CTA—make it concrete and actionable
- **Q&A (10-15 minutes):** Leave buffer for questions

### Customization for Different Audiences
- **Mostly Executives:** Spend more time on Slides 2, 4, 8 (context, outcomes, proof); keep architecture light
- **Technical Audience:** Spend more time on Slide 6 (architecture) and pull in Appendix slides (data model, ML details)
- **Mixed Audience:** Balance all slides but emphasize Slide 7 (persona journey) to bridge business and technical

### Engagement Techniques
- **Start with a question:** "How many of you have guest data in more than 5 systems?" (expect hands to go up)
- **Tell a story:** Use Slide 3 persona pains as a narrative—"Let me introduce you to Sarah, your Revenue Manager..."
- **Pause for reactions:** After showing outcomes on Slide 4, ask: "Which of these outcomes would be most valuable to you?"
- **Use the demo:** If time allows, weave in 5-10 minutes of live demo between Slides 7 and 8

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Don't lead with Snowflake products:** Start with business pain, not "Snowflake Cortex ML"
- **Don't skip the persona slide:** This is where you connect emotionally—don't rush it
- **Don't over-promise timelines:** Be realistic about pilot duration and rollout
- **Don't forget the CTA:** End with a concrete next step—don't leave it open-ended
